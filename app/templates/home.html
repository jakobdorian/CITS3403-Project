  <p>Welcome to Memory Flash! </p> 
  <p>The memory game to improve and test concentration.</p><br>
  <p>
    In ancient times, the ability to memorise was a prized skill. According to
    Northwestern University psychology professor Paul Reber, our brains can
    store up to 2.5 petabytes of data. That’s the same as three million hours of
    TV shows!
  <p>Having a good memory has been proven to boost brain health,
    problem solving abilities, reading comprehension and focus. Memory strength
    is just like muscular strength, so the more you use it, the stronger you’ll
    get. Playing this game is a great way to strengthen your brain’s memory
    capacity. </p>
  <p> It’s time to take control of your memory, start absorbing all the
    information that comes to you, and always have it at your fingertips!
